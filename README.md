# Regional_climate_data_downscaling
These codes are used to downscale the regional climate datasets (Gaussian Grid)   
The output projection is MODIS Sinusoidal projection at 500m spatial resolution (Same with MOD09A1, MOD15A2H, etc.)   
The input are netCDF dataset, the out put files are also in netCDF  
The method used can be found in Zhang et al. 2016.
